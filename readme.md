## Abstract

This is an original study of gerrymandering in Alabama. We well test three methods of shape-based compactness scores, assess the representativeness of districts based on prior presidential elections and race. We will then extend prior studies by calculating representativeness of the convex hull of district polygons.

This study is based on literature on gerrymandering metrics:

-   [Practical application of district compactness (1993)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0962-6298(93)90031-2)
-   [Gerrymandering and Compactness: Implementation Flexibility and Abuse (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1017/pan.2020.36)
-   [Discrete geometry for electoral geography (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.polgeo.2023.103040)

This study is **exploratory** in design, with the goal of evaluating usefulness of a new gerrymandering metric based on the convex hull of a congressional district and representative capability inside the convex hull compared to the congressional district.

## Compendium structure and contents

This research compendium is structured with four main directories:

-   `data`: contains subdirectories for `raw` data and `derived` data.
-   `docs`: contains subdirectories for `manuscript`, `presentation`, and `report`
-   `procedure`: contains subdirectories for `code` or software scripts, information about the computational `environment` in which the research was conducted, and non-code research `protocols`
-   `results`: contains subdirectories for `figures`, formatted data `tables`, or `other` formats of research results.

The data, procedures, and results of this repository are outlined in three tables:

-   Data: [data/data_index.csv](data/data_index.csv)
-   Procedures: [procedure/procedure_index.csv](procedure/procedure_index.csv)
-   Results: [results/results_index.csv](results/results_index.csv)
